# EMMER: Simplify the Input for Principal Component Analysis

## What is EMMER?
EMMER, which stands for Entropy-based Method for Microbial Ecology Research, is **a feature selection algorithm that reduces the number of measurements in a matrix while allowing this new matrix to retains a similar data distribution on a PCA plot** (see figure illustration below or [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m2O658NZMInmYYlyI9AdUuz2hbg14U6X/view?usp=sharing)).

We named this algorithm EMMER because we originally developed this algorithm to processing data from microbiota/microbiome studies. Later we realize this algorithm has wider application because the shared mathematical procedure between EMMER algorithm and PCA share.
